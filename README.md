## User Stories

        List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to be able to input my data, so users can navigate the app in order to create their own sub.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can improve on what the users want in order to make the app better to navigate.
